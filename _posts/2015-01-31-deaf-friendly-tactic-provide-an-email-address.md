**Update 1/31/2015**: I realized just after writing this that video relay is possible with the same phone number &#8230; whoops, that shows how long it&#8217;s been since I&#8217;ve made a single phone call! But in any case, I think the ideas in this article are still valid, and not every deaf person knows sign language.

**Original article**: In my search for [deaf-friendly tactics that are straightforward to implement][1], I initially observed that it&#8217;s so much easier for me to understand someone when [he or she speaks clearly][2] (not necessarily loudly). I also pointed out that in a group situation, [two people (me and one other person)][3] is optimal (not three, not four&#8230;). Two recent events led me to think of another super simple deaf-friendly tactic. In retrospect, I&#8217;m surprised it took me a few years to write about it.

I recently had to schedule an appointment with Toyota of Berkeley to get my car serviced. I also received a jury duty summons for late February, and I figured that it would be best if I requested a sign language interpreter to be with me for my summons. Unfortunately, for both of these cases, calling Toyota and the California courts, respectively, seemed to be the only way that I could achieve my goals.

In fact, my jury summons form said the following:

> Persons with disabilities and those requiring hearing assistance may request accommodations by contacting the court at [phone number redacted].

There was nothing else. I checked the summons form multiple times. There was no email address, no [TTY number][4], no [video relay service number][5], nothing. Yes, I am not joking. Someone who is hearing impaired &#8212; and logically will have difficulty communicating over the phone &#8212; will have to obtain jury duty accommodations by &#8230; calling the court! I actually tried to call with my iPhone 6. After multiple attempts, I realized that there was a pre-recorded message which said something like: &#8220;for doing X, press 1, for doing X, press 2&#8230;&#8221;, so I had to press a number to talk to a human. Actually, I think it&#8217;s probably best that there *was* no human on the other end, because otherwise I probably would have frustrated him or her by my constant requests for clarification.

I will fully admit that the iPhone 6 is not perfect for hearing aid users because its [Hearing Aid Compatible rating is M3, T4][6] rather than the optimal M4, T4 rating, but still, even after about five or six attempts at calling, I did not understand what numbers corresponded to what activities. Sure, I&#8217;m rusty since I make around two phone calls a year to people outside of my immediate family, but I don&#8217;t see experience being much of a factor here.

This motives the following simple deaf-friendly tactic:

> Provide an email address (perhaps in addition to a telephone number) that people can use to contact for support, scheduling services, and other activities.

I am aware that deaf people can easily use alternative services, such as TTY or video relay. Such services, however, are *far inferior* to email in many ways. Email nowadays is so prevalent in our lives and is incredibly easy to use. It&#8217;s rare when I don&#8217;t have some form of Internet access, so I can effectively check email *whenever I want*. The fact that I&#8217;m also *writing* instead of *talking* means that I can do things like revise my ideas more clearly and paste relevant web links. The process of forming an email can sometimes result in me resolving my own situation! I&#8217;ve often been in the process of writing an email, but then I realized I needed to add more information to show the person on the other end that I had done my research, but then that extra research I do can lead to an answer.

Furthermore, the set of people who regularly use email form effectively a proper superset over those people who use TTY and video relay services. In other words, the vast majority of TTY and video relay users *also* use email, but the converse is not true. In my case, I have not used TTY and video relay in *years*; email forms the foundation of almost all my communication nowadays. As long as it doesn&#8217;t become an obsession (as in checking it 50 times a day), I don&#8217;t see how it interferes that much in my daily life, and I would argue that a telephone call can drag on and on.

Conclusion: if you&#8217;re going to provide a phone number for contact, I would strongly urge you to also provide an email address.
