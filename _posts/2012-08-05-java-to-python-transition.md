Java was the first programming language I felt comfortable enough to write lengthy programs that, for instance, could be used to advance the goals of a research project. So for my first program needed for my [summer research][1] at the [Bard College REU][2], I used Java. I wrote code to create a random sentence generator. That was during my second week of the REU, and I had writen *one* significant Python script in my life, which was for a bonus question from my Algorithm Design & Analysis homework.

Let&#8217;s fast forward a bit. By the time the REU ended, I had written over 20 significant programs &#8230; in *Python*. So what happened?

At the start of the REU, I knew much more about Java than Python. But after some prodding by my advisors, and the fact that everyone else in my research project was using Python, I switched languages. I soon found &#8212; as they said I would &#8212; that Python was so much easier to write than Java. In particular, the file input and output is so stunningly simple, yet incredibly useful, a must for all the scripts we wrote that involved manipulating files. My project, after all, was about text simplification, and all the relevant corpora were stored in files. 

I also found it easier to understand the official [Python documentation][3] than [Java&#8217;s][4], so looking up things was less of a challenge. Like the guy who wrote this (heavily biased) article about [Python versus Java][5], I have to look up a lot of things for Java, whereas the same became a bit less true for Python.

My experience confirmed what I&#8217;ve heard that learning new languages is easier once one becomes proficient at another language. Well, with the possible exception of [Malbolge][6].
