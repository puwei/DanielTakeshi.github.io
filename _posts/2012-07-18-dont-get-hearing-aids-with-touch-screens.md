A few months ago, I made a Facebook status update announcing how happy I was to have new hearing aids. Well, I&#8217;m still glad to have them, but I have one main gripe about their touch screen. The *slightest drop of sweat* that contacts the touch screen will cause the hearing aid to act unpredictably.

My hearing aid model can be found [here][1]. And as you can guess, instead of having the old-fashioned hearing aid switch that you click to increase the volume control, there&#8217;s a touch screen instead. Pushing your fingertips up the back of the hearing aid will increase volume; pushing it down will decrease volume. And touching the hearing aid will change the mode (e.g. the T-coil, or telecoil).

Actually, that&#8217;s almost as annoying to me as my main gripe, which I mentioned earlier. Suppose I have an itch near the back of my ear. If I inadvertently touch the back of the hearing aid while trying to relieve myself, I&#8217;ll change the mode when I don&#8217;t want to. This forces me to make a few more touches in order to get it back to the old mode. And switching modes causes a temporary blockage of sound from entering my ear.

But to me, the bigger problem is that if I engage in any sort of physical activity for just a few minutes, the sweat that gets in touch with the hearing aid will cause it to behave abnormally. When my hearing aids first acted weirdly by making a lot of beep-beep-beep sounds due to sweat, I thought they were breaking down. But then I realized that the sweat was causing the hearing aid mode to change! The sweat seemingly perturbs the touch screen and causes it to touch itself. So I end up tapping the hearing aid a few more times to get it back to the right mode. But then it changes modes again! And again! The cycle continues. 

So, for instance, when I go to the weight room, I make sure I have my backup hearing aids on, which do not have a touch screen. Alternatively, I&#8217;ll just take off the hearing aids. (This presents a multitude of additional risks, so I wouldn&#8217;t recommend it if you&#8217;re not experienced with lifting weights, or if the gym is especially crowded.)

I&#8217;ve learned my lesson. I&#8217;m still happy to wear these hearing aids, but when I get new pairs in a few years, I&#8217;ll be sure to avoid the ones with touch screens.
