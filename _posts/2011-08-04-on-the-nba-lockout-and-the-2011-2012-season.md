According to ESPN, it&#8217;s likely that the [2011-2012 NBA season will be canceled][1]. That&#8217;s truly a shame, as I was hoping to see another season of my favorite team, the Dallas Mavericks, and possibly my favorite player, Dirk Nowitzki, while they were still at their peak. (And defend their titles to be the 2012 NBA champions and the 2012 NBA Finals MVP, respectively, but I&#8217;m dreaming here.) The problem with an NBA lockout is that it causes these older teams &#8212; like the Mavericks &#8212; to lose an advantage to the younger players as it&#8217;s extremely difficult to stay in NBA-caliber shape as Father Time takes the reins. An NBA lockout also puts Dirk Nowitzki&#8217;s quest for 30,000 points in danger. He has 22,792 points, but just turned 33. For the players, and possibly some diehard fans, there&#8217;s always Europe where [New Jersey Nets star Deron Williams is likely to head in the case of a canceled season][2]. An ersatz league compared to the NBA, but it&#8217;s better than nothing.

But what possibly frustrates me the most about the current NBA lockout is the lack of information. The NBA claims that 22 out of the 30 teams are losing money, yet they&#8217;re somehow encapsulating the data. (Despite the popularity of the sport, this isn&#8217;t an entirely spurious claim, since a lot of money has been shed unwisely to pay unproductive players.) Owners are demanding a greater share of profits, but what exactly are their balance sheets looking like? And what are the opinions of the players, whose very presence is needed to even consider continuing the NBA as the best professional basketball league in the world? As a fan, I&#8217;d really appreciate any attempt by the league to shed some light on how and when the lockout can be resolved.

If I had to wager, I&#8217;d think that the 2011-2012 season won&#8217;t be canceled. There&#8217;s just too much money and talent lost if the winter and spring seasons go by without the ultimate professional basketball league. But I cannot fathom a case where the season starts by the end of October. It&#8217;s likely to be a shortened season, as in the 1998-1999 NBA season all over again. And despite all evidence to the contrary, I remain optimistic that there will be a season.

I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;m in need of a post in my third category, &#8220;everything deaf.&#8221; I&#8217;ll get to that shortly.
