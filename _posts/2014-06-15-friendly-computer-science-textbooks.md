I&#8217;d been meaning to post this earlier, but I got sidetracked by [Project Euler][1] (more on that later). In any case, I want to list a few computer science textbooks that, in my opinion, are written in a friendly style and are easy for someone to read like a novel. These are my favorite kind of textbooks, because they often incorporate two important aspects: *elaboration* and *examples*. Notice that this does *not* mean that mastering the corresponding subject is easy! It just makes it *easier* for an experienced and educated reader to do so.

I&#8217;m inspired to think about this because, as much as I enjoyed my complex analysis class last fall, the [textbook][2] we used glosses over so many details that it made analyzing some of the proofs excruciatingly difficult. At least, for me &#8230; I can&#8217;t speak for everyone in the class, but my professor did have to explain that the goal of his lectures was to emphasize *why* the authors/book did something in their proofs.

In the past few weeks, I read parts of [Methods of Mathematical Economics][3], a textbook about the mathematics behind linear programming and other popular applied mathematics techniques. It is written in a conversational style (the author uses &#8220;I&#8221; instead of &#8220;we&#8221;), and it was very helpful to me for a final project.

Here are four books on the computer science side that I&#8217;ve found to be very readable.

  1. [Algorithm Design][4], by [Jon Kleinberg][5], and [Eva Tardos][6], presents an introduction to the common themes underlying an algorithms course. I enjoyed it because it emphasizes the decision-making behind many of the proofs. In addition, it contains several sample problems with detailed solutions. These solutions also explain why certain approaches might not work or are suboptimal.
  2. [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach][7], by [Stuart Russell][8] and [Peter Norvig][9], is a surprisingly readable &#8220;encyclopedia-like&#8221; book about AI. I do *not *recommend reading the entire thing, especially in one sitting! But if you pick out a single chapter, the book should serve you well. I talked with Stuart when I was visiting Berkeley, and he told me I needed to know more learning theory. I asked him how I could learn more, and he said: &#8220;read the book.&#8221; Good &#8212; I&#8217;ll do that!
  3. [Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms][10], by [Andrew S. Tanenbaum][11] and [Maarten Van Steen][12], is about concepts of distributed systems (i.e., those relying on multiple computers/machines). This book is *filled* with examples. Almost every concept is explained with an immediate real-life example.
  4. [Introduction to the Theory of Computation][13], by [Michael Sipser][14], overlaps somewhat with *Algorithm Design*, but emphasizes automata, computability, and complexity, rather than pure algorithms. It is a concise book, but somehow provides the impression that it&#8217;s detailed and expansive. Fortunately, each chapter contains problems with full solutions.

I&#8217;d be interested in knowing if there are other popular, readable computer science textbooks.
