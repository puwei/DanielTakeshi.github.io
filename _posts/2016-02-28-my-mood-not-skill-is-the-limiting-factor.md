When I'm doing some homework, research, or trying to learn a concept, I want skill to be my limiting
factor. What do I mean by this? I mean that if I'm having difficulty doing some work, the reason
should be straightforward: the work is challenging, and I need more skill (or more accurately, that
plus lots of focus and effort) to be able to accomplish my objectives.

Unfortunately, in recent times it has not been skill that is my limiting factor, but how well I
feel.

I'm writing this post after a week when I was stressed over feeling isolated, both in terms of
research and in terms of social settings. The former is because I haven't made much research
progress, and I feel like I'm cut off from the research community. The latter is, well, kind of
obvious.

When I tried to do work this past week, the limiting factor was how well I could bring myself to
focus and keep my thoughts about isolation at bay.

Almost all of my negative experiences, almost all of my sources of stress and depression, can be
traced back to some sort of isolation.

This explains my frustration, which is another suitable word to describe my Berkeley experience so
far. I feel like I'm capable of so much more, except I keep getting distracted. The result is that I
feel like I'm in a deep hole and I can't climb out.

I can't believe that most people want to feel this way. As far as I understand, humans are
social creatures, and people want to feel like *they belong*. I view myself as a social person, even
if I sometimes cannot convey that message clearly enough. I think about social settings all the
time; it's a common theme that appears when my mind wanders. Unfortunately, reality usually strikes
a few moments later, in the sense that there are many people who I *want* to talk with, but I don't
feel like I can talk with them. I might think they're out of my league socially, or that
communication would be difficult for some reason (e.g., accents).

Fortunately, whenever I *do* get an extensive conversation with someone, it's enough to keep me
refreshed and deplete my internal "isolation meter" for a few days.

The bar for me being happy is set *really* low.

In the meantime, I have to learn how to stay positive, and I'll continue searching for people I can
work with, hoping that ... at ... some ... point ... I can find [that true, collaborator to answer
my dreams][1].
