I&#8217;ve only been a Berkeley student for about three weeks, but I&#8217;m already appreciating how quick and easy it has been to get accommodations for various events. To do so, one just needs to go to the [Disability Access Services website][2], fill out a two-page online form, and submit. I&#8217;ve filed about half a dozen requests already, an indication of how many meetings I&#8217;ll need to be attending to during my time in Berkeley. (Though I&#8217;m probably better off than the tenured professors here in that regard.)

The services one can request fall in two categories: communication and mobility. I&#8217;m only familiar with the communications aspect, which includes sign language interpreting and real-time captioning. Since this is the first time I&#8217;ve really been able to take advantage of captioning availability, I&#8217;m trying out a mix &#8212; some events with captioning, some with interpreting.

Not only is it easy to obtain these services, it&#8217;s also quite reliable. I&#8217;ve never had a request denied or forgotten. In fact, I even got a captioner for a new graduate student meeting despite giving only 36 hours of advance notice. (I had forgotten that it was happening &#8230; won&#8217;t do that again!) I&#8217;ve met a few of the people who work at the access services group, and they&#8217;re all really friendly. They are closely related to the [Disabled Students&#8217; Program][3] at Berkeley, which is designed to help accommodate students for class-related purposes.

I think even people who aren&#8217;t affiliated with Berkeley in some way can request accommodations for events, though they might need to pay a small fee. Berkeley students can get them for free.
